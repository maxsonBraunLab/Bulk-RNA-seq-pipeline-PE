# Genome assembly used for GO analysis, format must be as below, with the genome assembly first, and the version of ensembl second, separated by a period (Unless there is only one ensembl version, then just write assembly).
# Currently allowed assembly options (as of 4/25/22): mm10, hg19, hg38.89, or hg38.90
assembly:

# The column name of the characteristic you would like to do DE on. Example: Diagnosis, genotype, etc. This must be a column in your omic_meta_data.

# The column name in which your sampleIDs are defined in omic_meta_data. These should match the sampleIDs in your fastq files.
sample_id:
  #Column name listing unique sample ids to be used. This needs to be the first column in the meta data file

# The column names in your omic_meta_data file which you would like to annotate your heatmaps by. This is used as a QC to look for batch effects. Enter columns which could potentially introduce a batch effect in your data.

# Contrasts which you would like to run differential expression on.
# For example if you want to look at wild type (wt) vs. mutant (mut), you would specify mut-vs-wt
# It is important that when listing your types here, you write your baseline SECOND

# If you would like to colour your QC plots by an RColorBrewer palette, list that palette under the rcolorbrewer parameter, otherwise, write "NA"
# If you would like to colour your QC plots by specific colours, please list them under the discrete category, with one colour for each bullet point
## The discrete colours will be assigned to your Conditions (ie. linear_model) in the order that they show up in your metadata table, when it is ordered alphabetically by sample ID
## There must be the same number of colours listed as there are Conditions
# If no options are specified, the default ggplot2 colours are used
